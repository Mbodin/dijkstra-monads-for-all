Coq development for the paper:
- Kenji Maillard, Danel Ahman, Robert Atkey, Guido Martinez,
  Cătălin Hriţcu, Exequiel Rivas, and Éric Tanter.
  **[Dijkstra Monads for All](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01237)**.
  arXiv:1903.01237. March, 2019.


# Prerequisites

This development requires the `master` branch of Coq here:
https://github.com/coq/coq/commits/master
(in particular the following commit is known to work: 6960da47)

It also requires the equations plugin, `master` branch (only for the
General recursion examples at the end of DijkstraMonadExamples.v;
comment out if not needed): https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations
(in particular the following commit is known to work: 6feef06e)

These are already installed in our Docker image.


# Step-by-step Guide

Run `make` from this directory to compile all the coq files
(this step is needed for the walkthrough). It should succeed
displaying only warnings and coq terms.

The file `theories/README.v` provides a step-by-step walkthrough
that maps the claims of the paper to parts of the Coq development.

The best way to follow along is to go through this file with emacs.
(emacs and Proof General are installed in our Docker image)


# Organisation of the directories

- theories/          : root of all the Coq files
- theories/sprop     : development of Dijkstra monads using SProp
- theories/SRelation : adaptation of part of the standard library to SProp
- theories/SM        : SM language and denotations

# Axioms and assumptions

Most of the development uses the recent SProp feature of Coq (instead of relying on UIP axiom).

The functional extensionality axiom from Coq's standard library is used
extensively in the development, as well as two variations of it with 
respect to SProp (that can be found in `theories/sprop/SPropBase.v`, module `SPropAxioms`). 
This module also defines the axiom of propositional extensionality 
for strict propositions.

The use of these axioms can be checked for instance at the end of 
`theories/README.v` using `Print Assumptions term.`.

As mentioned in Section 7 of the paper, "the mechanized version of
Theorem 2 thus assumes a semantic hypothesis requiring that the
denotation of bind is homomorphic, and under this assumption derives
the full monad transformer (including all the laws) in Coq."

No proof in the developement is admitted.
